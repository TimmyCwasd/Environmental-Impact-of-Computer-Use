        <td>Large amounts of greenhouse gases are released every year as a result of computer prodution. Research has found that just the manufacturing and transportation alone makes up 85% of the greenhouse gas emissions from a computer used for 6 years.
        <ul>
          <li>Harvesting the materials and minerals used for computer part production uses lots of energy and releases pollution due to harmful mining practises</li>
          <li>Many parts such as the motherboard need high-precision lasers that consume a lot of energy which could be supplied by fossil fuels</li>
          <li>As most parts are produced overseas, they need to be shipped by large cargo boats that produce around 1000 megatons of carbon dioxide per year</li>

          <li>Maintaining the servers that hold the data for your videos, the router that gives you access to the internet and transferring the data to your device all uses large amounts of energy that are commonly supplied by fossil fuels.</li>
          <li>Powering the computer for use uses about 40 watts which is energy that may have released greenhouse gases to produce</li>

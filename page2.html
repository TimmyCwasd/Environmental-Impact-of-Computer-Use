        <ul>
          <li>Harvesting the materials and minerals used for computer part production uses lots of energy and releases pollution due to harmful mining practises</li>
          <li>Many parts such as the motherboard need high-precision lasers that consume a lot of energy which could be supplied by fossil fuels</li>
          <li>As most parts are produced overseas, they need to be shipped by large cargo boats that produce around 1000 megatons of carbon dioxide per year</li>
